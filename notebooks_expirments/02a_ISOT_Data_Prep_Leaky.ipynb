Reuters reported on Thursday that Trump was considering issuing an order that would have increased to 100 percent the current requirement that 50 percent of such aid be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stopped short of confirming information about the order but said he had discussed the issue with Trump and that he understands that the shift would have increased the cost of food aid and caused more people to starve. \\u201cI had a good conversation today with President Trump,\\u201d Corker said in a statement emailed to Reuters. \\u201cAs a businessman, he understands that expanding the cargo preference would substantially drive up the cost of food aid and cause more people to starve around the world,\\u201d Corker said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative originally touted as part of Trump\\u2019s \\u201cAmerica First\\u201d platform might have slowed food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said. Aid groups, and members of Congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. The United States, the world\\u2019s largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. About half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. The conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute said in a November report that shipping food aid on U.S.-flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer. Jeremy Konyndyk, a former director of USAID\\u2019s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, welcomed the administration\\u2019s decision to drop the order. Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, said that with four potential famines in the world \\u201cit would have been the worst possible moment to be shifting money out of hungry mouths and into subsidies for big shipping conglomerates.\\u201d Corker has been pushing for years to reform the U.S. food aid program, including by eliminating the cargo preference. He said in his statement he looked forward to working with Congress and the administration to achieve \\u201clong overdue reforms.\\u201d After hearing about the possible executive order, several members of Congress called the White House to express their concern, congressional aides said. The administration\\u2019s budget proposal has suggested slashing foreign aid in general while increasing defense spending. That plan was also met with stiff opposition in Congress, as lawmakers argued that \\u201csoft power\\u201d options such as food and medical aid and disaster recovery assistance can be effective tools in foreign policy that should not be discounted. Supporters say Trump\\u2019s initiative would not only create new U.S. jobs in the shipping industry but that U.S.-controlled food shipments are important for national security because the U.S. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict. Food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, critics argue, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military. They said the costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower-cost international carriers, requiring more U.S. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people.\",\n          \"The LGBT Mafia and PC Police doing what they do best shaming Americans and businesses into conformity. Does anyone have the courage or fortitude to fight back, or are we just going to allow these PC thugs to strip our children of the genders God clearly assigned to each of us? Target Corp. is removing gender labels from most of its children s departments after customers complained about signs designating certain toys for girls.The kids bedding section will no longer feature boy and girl signage, and the toy department will be without labels and pink or blue paper on the shelves, Minneapolis-based Target said on its website Friday. Gender labels will remain in the kids clothing section because of sizing and fit differences.Retailers have been moving away from gender stereotypes, and some startups have emerged to break down the divide in kids clothing and toys. The signage that sparked the dispute at Target was for building sets, like GoldieBlox, that are targeted at girls. As guests have pointed out, in some departments like toys, home or entertainment, suggesting products by gender is unnecessary, Target said. We heard you, and we agree. Right now, our teams are working across the store to identify areas where we can phase out gender-based signage to help strike a better balance. In June, Ohio mom Abi Bechtel called out Target s gender designations in its toy aisle. She posted a photo to Twitter that showed store signs for Girls Building Sets next to regular Building Sets. The outcry was swift, with angry shoppers calling for change. It stood out to me as a good example of the way our culture tends to view boys and men as the default, normal option and girls and women as the specialized option, Bechtel told CNN at the time.Via:

I always thought that I myself didn t stigmatize abortion, Dunham says in the most recent episode of her podcast, titled Choice. I m a uh abortion rights activist, it s a huge part of who I am, she added, but then said she had distanced herself from the issue of abortion in the past.She continued:But one day, when I was visiting a Planned Parenthood in Texas a few years ago, a young girl walked up to me and asked me if I d like to be a part of her project in which women share their stories of abortions. I sort of jumped. I haven t had an abortion, I told her. I wanted to make it really clear to her that as much as I was going out and fighting for other women s options, I myself had never had an abortion.And I realized then that even I was carrying within myself stigma around this issue. Even I, the woman who cares as much as anybody about a woman s right to choose, felt it was important that people know I was unblemished in this department. So many people I love my mother, my best friends have had to have abortions for all kinds of reasons, Dunham said. I feel so proud of them for their bravery, for their self-knowledge, and it was a really important moment for me then to realize I had internalized some of what society was throwing at us and I had to put it in the garbage. Now I can say that I still haven t had an abortion, but I wish I had, she said.As Newsbusters notes, Dunham has now become an avid supporter of abortion.Read more: Breitbart\",\n          \"I know you ll miss me.

I know you ll miss me, he joked to reporters after signing a bill preserving wilderness land in Idaho.With no official appearances on the schedule, Obama, Michelle and their youngest daughter Sasha will spend the time away from Washington dabbling in their usual vacation activities: leisurely rounds of golf, beach outings, hikes and bike rides, and dinner at some of the island s top
